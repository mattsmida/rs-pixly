# Saltly - A Web-Based Photo Sharing and Editing Platform

Saltly is a web-based application that allows users to view, upload, and edit photos. The key features of this project include:

* **User accessibility**: No login or authentication is required for any user to access the platform's features.
* **Photo uploads**: Users can upload JPG photos using an upload form and selecting a file from their computer.
* **Image editing**: Users can convert color photos to black and white, adding a classic touch to their images.
* **PostgreSQL and Amazon S3**: Combines the power of a PostgreSQL database for managing application data with Amazon S3 for scalable and secure photo storage, ensuring a smooth user experience.

This project offered an opportunity to learn about file uploads, integrating with Amazon S3 for storage, and implementing basic image editing features using python's PIL library.

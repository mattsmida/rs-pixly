# Saltly - A Web-Based Photo Sharing and Editing Platform

Saltly is a web application built using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Amazon S3. It allows users to view, upload, and edit photos. This project provided an opportunity to build an application from scratch with a quick turnaround time.

## Key features of this project

* **User accessibility**: No login or authentication is required for any user to access the platform's features.
* **Photo uploads**: Users can upload JPG photos using an upload form and selecting a file from their computer.
* **Image editing**: Users can convert color photos to black and white, adding a classic touch to their images.
* **PostgreSQL and Amazon S3**: Combines the power of a PostgreSQL database for managing application data with Amazon S3 for scalable and secure photo storage, ensuring a smooth user experience.

This project offered an opportunity to learn about file uploads, integrating with Amazon S3 for storage, and implementing basic image editing features using python's PIL library.
